# Hi, I'm Odai Beshr 👋

I'm a **Mobile & Web Developer** obsessed with clean architecture and pixel-perfect UI.

I design and build systems that are as robust on the inside as they are beautiful on the outside. If a logic puzzle needs solving or a UI needs polishing, I’m the one building it.

My main tech stack includes **Flutter** for cross-platform mobile apps, **React (Tailwind)** for modern web interfaces, and **Laravel** for powerful backends. My favorite tools are **VS Code**, the **Command Line** (for deep troubleshooting), and **Git** (for maintaining a pristine history).

I’ve got several pinned projects, but my current focus is bridging the gap between complex algorithms (like my Java Triage System) and user-friendly designs.

I don’t just write code; I adhere to strict engineering standards. From **Conventional Commits** to optimizing **database queries**, I believe details matter.
